[WOMAN 1]
A new world calls across the ocean
A new world calls across the sky
A new world whispers in the shadows:
"Time to fly, time to fly..."

[MAN 2]
It's about one moment-
The moment before it all becomes clear
And in that one moment
You start to believe there's nothing to fear
It's about one second-
And just when you're on the verge of success
The sky starts to change
And the wind starts to blow...

And, oh, you're suddenly a stranger
There's no explaining where you stand
And you didn't know
That you sometimes have to go
'round an unexpected bend
And the road will end
In a new world

[WOMAN 1]
A new world calls for me to follow
A new world waits for my reply
A new world holds me to a promise
Standing by, standing by...

[WOMAN 2]
It's about one moment-
That moment you think you know where you stand
And in that one moment
The things that you're sure of slip from your hand
And you've got one second
To try to be clear, to try to stand tall
But nothing's the same
And the wind starts to blow...

And, oh, you're suddenly a stranger
In some completely different land
And you thought you knew
But you didn't have a clue
That the surface sometimes cracks
To reveal the tracks
To a new world!

[MAN 1, MAN 2, WOMAN 2, ALL 3]
You have a house in the hills
You have a job on the coast
You find a lover you're sure you believe in
You get a pool in the back
You get the part of your life
You hold the ring in your hand
